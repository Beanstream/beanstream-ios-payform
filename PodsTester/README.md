# Checkout Test for iOS

Checkout is a small client-side iOS (Swift) framework project that handles customer credit card input within the merchant's app. Most apps will let users launch Checkout from something like a button action.

The Checkout iOS framework limits the scope of a merchant's PCI compliance by removing the need for them to pass the sensitive information (credit card number, CVD, or expiry) through their servers and from having to write and store code that comes in contact with that sensitive information.

Note that the PodsTester project is used to demonstrate how to import and use Checkout using CocoaPods.

## Checkout Framework

This demo uses the [Checkout](https://github.com/Bambora/na-ios-checkout) framework.
